This is a FP Unreal 5 C++ project which is a game about the Rubic's Cube
It showcases the complex transform handling for the orientations of a Rubic's Cube as commanded by the player
The design has been chosen such that the full cube is fundamentally assembled from many small 'CubeLets' on BeginPlay. 
Every different orientation(Rotation) commanded by the player results in specific CubeLets to group together and move as a single body.
